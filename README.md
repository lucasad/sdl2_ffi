# sdl2_ffi

This is a simple interface to SDL2 for Ruby using FFI.  This effort has barely started.

## Dependencies

* Obviously, ruby
* SDL2 Runtime (Development files are not needed.)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sdl2_ffi'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sdl2_ffi

## Usage

The interface is intended to be modular and follows (roughly) SDL's header files.

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

I specifically need help writing the minitest code.
